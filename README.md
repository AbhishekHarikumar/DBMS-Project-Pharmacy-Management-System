# DBMS-Project-Pharmacy-Management-system

Pharmacy Management System is an online Website used to store and retrieve the different types of products available in our warehouse and the users who have ordered them, along with further details. The primary purpose of this software is to reduce the manual stress involved in visiting a store and can receive the products in comfort in their own home. This system simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the pharmacy.

Highlights🚀:

✽ Designed the database design involving the ER Diagram, Database Schema, and Relational Schema. The Normalization here follows 3NF. 

✽ The Application is safely designed in such a way that the user's data is in an encrypted format and is hence secure. Stored procedures and triggers were implemented in the carts and products table. Good use of front-end tools and technologies to create a simple yet elegant interface.
